# Example yeast Mig1-GFP slimfield data

In this dataset, a transcription factor, Mig1 is labelled with GFP in a yeast cell. The cell was imaged on a dual colour slimfield microscope. The green channel is on the left. Initial frames are dark before the laser turns on around frame 30. The protein rapidly photobleaches but distinct fluorescent foci are visible.
