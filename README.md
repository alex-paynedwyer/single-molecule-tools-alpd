# Single molecule tools (Alex Payne-Dwyer)

Forked from [single-molecule-tools](https://awollman.github.io/single-molecule-tools/) (authors Adam Wollman and Isabel Llorente-Garcia, c. 2018).

This repository comprises a series of Matlab functions and scripts called **ADEMScode** for tracking and quantification of spots in images, deconvolution, segmentation and simulation. It is also capable of estimating single molecule concentrations from volumetric models and 2D images. It is broadly useful for localisation microscopy, step-wise photobleaching, STORM, PALM, FRAP and regular fluorescence microscopy data in 16-bit .tif, .czi and other BioFormat image stack types.

Novel functionality here includes distribution-based estimates of periodic clustering in molecular assemblies, as well as scripts for visualising correlated properties of trajectories colocalised across two channels.
